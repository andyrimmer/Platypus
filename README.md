#Platypus

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IvantheDugtrio/Platypus.svg?branch=master)

The Platypus variant caller. The main Web site is https://github.com/andyrimmer/Platypus.

##Installation and execution

To build Platypus, do the following:

    make

Then to run do

    python bin/Platypus.py --bamFiles=BAM.bam --refFile=REF.fa --output=variants.vcf

Platypus has been tested with Python 3.6 and above, and requires Cython 3.0.6 or later
to build.

####Prerequisites

Platypus requires HTSlib 1.2.1 or greater. HTSlib can be downloaded from the [HTSlib Web site](http://www.htslib.org/download/).

To build and install HTSlib, cd into HTSlib source and type `make install`. This will install HTSlib under `/usr/local/` (see note below). To install HTSlib in any other directory use `make install prefix=/path/to/dir`.

NOTE: HTSlib should be installed in a standard location (e.g. `/usr/local/`). If not installed in a standard location, you will need to set your library paths:

For GNU/Linux:

    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/dir/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dir/lib (only for making)
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dir/lib

Note the `/include` and `/lib` sub-directories. e.g. if you installed HTSlib under `/Users/me/htslib` then set

    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/Users/me/htslib/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/me/htslib/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/me/htslib/lib

HTSlib will automatically make the `include` and `lib` directories on install.

For OSX:

    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/dir/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dir/lib (only for making)
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dir/lib
